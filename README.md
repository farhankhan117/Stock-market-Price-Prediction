# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## 💡 Project Overview
In this project, we leverage historical stock market data to train an LSTM model. The model learns from past price patterns and trends, enabling it to predict future stock prices. The LSTM network is specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies and has proven to be effective in time series forecasting tasks.

## 📊 Dataset
We use a publicly available dataset containing historical stock prices of various companies. The dataset includes features like opening price, closing price, volume, etc.  
We preprocess the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and perform any necessary data transformations.

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Model Training
The LSTM model is built using deep learning frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.  
We train the model on the training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as:
- Number of hidden layers
- Number of neurons per layer
- Learning rate

We employ techniques like **regularization** and **dropout** to prevent overfitting.

## 📈 Evaluation and Results
Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance on the testing dataset.  
We compute various metrics to assess the model's accuracy:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

We visualize the **predicted stock prices** alongside the **actual prices** to gain insights into the model's performance.
